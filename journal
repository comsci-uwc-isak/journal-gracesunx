In today's class, we learned about Topic 3.4, including Common Ports used in the Internet (Layer 4 OSI model). I didn't quite 
understand the lesson today, however, I will spend some more time outside of class to catch up. 

Today is also my first IA dicussion with Mr. Ruben. He really likes the idea of designing a combini business, which makes me
feel more confident and hopeful about my IA now lol
