In today's class, we again separated into 2 different groups. Our group continued our learning on web development (HTML, 
CSS, Javascript). We created and designed a login page (without Javascript). I learned the different types of input, how to 
create classes, and more about CSS (ex. margin-left auto, position relative). Overall, I am really sastified with today's 
class, it was really helpful, and I hope I will be able to utlize these skills in my Computer Science IA.
