In today's class, we separated into 2 different groups. I was in the group of learning web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript),
and the other group was working on the VPN server with raspberry pi. I learned about the different types of files: Pug for 
HTML, Stylus forCSS, and Coffeescript for Javascript. 

It was a really good review for me since I have learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the past. I am more familiar with 
HTML and CSS, however, I still struggles with Javascript. For example, I am trying to understand what you did for the 
christmas counting down. But overall, I learned a lot. Looking forward to our next CS class.
