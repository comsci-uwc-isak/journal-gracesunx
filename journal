Today was really fun. I would say this is probably the most interesting computer science class I have ever had. Not only 
studying the slides or staring at the computer but also able to apply computer science in real life. I enjoyed working and 
solving problems together as a class, it allowed me to learn from others. I enjoyed the feeling of being challenged. 
And well, besides computer languages, we also got introduced to hand gesture language in order to accomplish the challenge: 
"Use hands. We are initiated."
