In today's class we started off by learning Topic 3.1.3 - Describe how communication over networks is broken down into 
different layers. We learned about the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. It is a conceptional model that componentizes 
the telecommunication functions into different layers. The model defines seven layers, and each layer sits independently on 
top of another one, as long as they follow defined structures and characteristics. 

Then, we connected to the raspberry pi's (ssh pi@...) web server (apache) and created a web page (Grace.html) under its IP 
address by using html and CSS. I have learned some basic html, CSS, and Javascript before, however, I haven't been using it 
for a long time, so today's lesson was a really good review for me. I was also a bit confused by the differences between web
server and web page, so I googled it and now I understand: A web server is a computer hosting one or more websites. "Hosting" 
means that all the web pages and their supporting files are available on that computer. The web server will send any web page 
from the website it is hosting to any user's browser, per user request.
