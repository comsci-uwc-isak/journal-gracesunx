In today's class, we learned about Data security, such as the public key, encryption, ascii chart, encode etc. We then used 
our HTML and CSS skills we learned earlier to create an Encryption Tool web page. I think I understand today's lesson quite 
well. I am really happy that we can be able to practice HTML and CSS every class and learn something new about it each class.
It really helps me to build a stronger and better understanding every session and I enjoyed it a lot. Hope we can continue
this way of leanrning:)
